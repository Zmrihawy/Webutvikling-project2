    "We recommend worsted weight yarn for most beginners as it is easier to see and control your stitches. We carry a variety of options to fit your price range, which can be found here. Most worsted weight yarn recommends a US size 6, 7, or 8 needle. Since most beginner knitters knit tightly, a size 8 is probably best. We carry several knitting needles in this size, which can be found here. At the end of your project, you will need to sew in the ends with a yarn needle, which we also carry here. A basic pair of small scissors such as these will also be helpful.",
    "A wide range of reproductive strategies have been noted in ant species. Females of many species are known to be capable of reproducing asexually through thelytokous parthenogenesis.[67] Secretions from the male accessory glands in some species can plug the female genital opening and prevent females from re-mating.[68] Most ant species have a system in which only the queen and breeding females have the ability to mate. Contrary to popular belief, some ant nests have multiple queens, while others may exist without queens. Workers with the ability to reproduce are called \"gamergates\" and colonies that lack queens are then called gamergate colonies; colonies with queens are said to be queen-right.[69]",
    "I am writing something. Yes, I plan to make it the most boring thing ever written. I go to the store. A car is parked. Many cars are parked or moving. Some are blue. Some are tan. They have windows. In the store, there are items for sale. These include such things as soap, detergent, magazines, and lettuce. You can enhance your life with these products. Soap can be used for bathing, be it in a bathtub or in a shower. Apply the soap to your body and rinse. Detergent is used to wash clothes. Place your dirty clothes into a washing machine and add some detergent as directed on the box. Select the appropriate settings on your washing machine and you should be ready to begin. Magazines are stapled reading material made with glossy paper, and they cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from news and politics to business and stock market information. Some magazines are concerned with more recreational topics, like sports card collecting or different kinds of hairstyles. Lettuce is a vegetable. It is usually green and leafy, and is the main ingredient of salads. You may have an appliance at home that can quickly shred lettuce for use in salads. Lettuce is also used as an optional item for hamburgers and deli sandwiches. Some people even eat lettuce by itself. I have not done this. So you can purchase many types of things at stores.",
    "Drape the tie around your collar with the seam facing inward and the thick end on your left, two or three inches lower than your desired finishing position. Bring the thick end horizontally across the front of the narrow end, and then pass it back horizontally behind the narrow end. Pass the thick end again across the front of the knot from left to right. Now pass the thick end again behind the knot horizontally from right to left. Pass the thick end AGAIN across the front of the knot from left to right. Slip a finger under this third horizontal loop. Bring the tip of the thick end up underneath the loop around your collar and feed it up behind the knot, down over the front of the knot and through that third horizontal loop. Pull the thick end through the horizontal loop and snug it down. Adjust the tie by holding the knot in one hand and pulling gently on the narrow end with the other."

It's a waste of time, a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, \"two plus two\". The people in the back say \"four\". Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can take a dump or something. I mean, it's-it's not place for smart people, Jerry, and I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.",
