    listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's yout hous. It's your world. You're a rea Julius Caesar, but I'll tell you some, tell you how-how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time, a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two". The people in the back say "four". Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can take a dump or something. I mean, it's-it's not place for smart people, Jerry, and I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.
